## Notice - Namespace Refactor
As of `v1.3.0`, the namespace for PiggyCustomEnchants has been changed from `PiggyCustomEnchants\Main` to `DaPigGuy\PiggyCustomEnchants\Main` in order to comply with Poggit's C1a rule. If you currently use the API, please make sure to update accordingly. We are sorry for the inconvenience this might have caused.

## FAQ
**Q:** How do I create/use an enchanted book? </br>
**A:** If you want to create an enchanted book, use the /ce enchant command on a normal book. Afterwards, you place the item you want to enchant on top of the enchanted book. It will then enchant your item. 

## Information
* We do not support any spoons. Anything to do with spoons (Issues or PRs) will be ignored.
* You can find a list of the current custom enchants in the [wiki](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants/wiki/Enchantments).
  * If you want a public custom enchant to be added, you can request it to be added by submitting them to our [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfWdk8OyQ6NNw6KiJxP_4CH4GHnKlaFr4VfZIQojk7OPlyoQ/viewform). You do not need to be logged in to submit a form. If you want credit to the idea, state your username anywhere in the form.
* We are using the [libFormAPI](https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI), so there is no need to install the FormAPI plugin.
    * In other words, you must use the pre-compiled phar from [Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants/~) instead of GitHub.
    * If you wish to run it via source, check out [DEVirion](https://github.com/poggit/devirion).
